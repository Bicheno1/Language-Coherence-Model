# db/db_emotion.py
#
# Same problem db_danger.py solved for danger words, but for ordinary
# emotion vocabulary: CONCEPTS is a small hand-authored graph, so a plain
# word like "joy", "anger", "sadness", "gratitude" or "fear" had NO entry
# of its own and fell through to the lexicon fallback with an EMPTY related.
#
# An audit of the lexicon's "emotion" category (64 words) found 57 with no
# push at all: effectively the entire everyday emotional vocabulary.
#
# EVERY template below reuses TAGS THAT ALREADY EXIST in the tag tables --
# this file adds no new calibration numbers, it only makes already-calibrated
# emotional dimensions reachable from the plain words a person uses to name them.
#
# Same mechanism as db_danger.py (mirrored on purpose, not reinvented):
# apply_emotion(CONCEPTS) is called once at import time from
# db/db_concepts.py, right after apply_danger(). A hand-authored word is
# never overwritten; only its still-empty inflected forms get the push.

# type/subtype for a word in neither CONCEPTS nor the lexicon
